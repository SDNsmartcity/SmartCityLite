# SmartCityLite – for smarter and greener cities

**CityLite** is a next-generation smart city platform for building, simulating, and analysing urban environments at scale

This project is developed and maintained by **SDNsmartcity Group** as the official **SmartCityLite v2**, building upon and integrating the foundations of the original SDNsmartcity platform launched last year.

---

## Notice

The original implementation of SmartCityLite relied on deprecated HERE Maps APIs.  
This version represents a **modernised, re-architected evolution** of the concept, rebuilt with production readiness, extensibility, and long-term maintainability in mind.

## About

SmartCityLite is a smart cities concept platform designed for **smarter, greener, and more data-driven urban development**.

Originally conceived as a rapid prototype, SmartCityLite has now evolved into a **product-ready system** through SDNsmartcity’s continued R&D efforts.  
This version focuses on real-world deployment, scalable architecture, and seamless integration of heterogeneous urban data sources.

SmartCityLite enables professionals in **Architecture, Engineering, Construction (AEC)** and **Smart City planning** to:

- Aggregate and visualise urban-scale data in a unified 3D environment  
- Simulate environmental and spatial scenarios before execution  
- Bridge BIM, GIS, IoT, and satellite data into a single decision layer  

---

## Platform Architecture

SmartCityLite acts as a **centralised urban intelligence layer**, integrating multiple data domains:

- **BIM** (IFC-based building models)
- **GIS** (GeoJSON and geospatial datasets)
- **Satellite & environmental data**
- **IoT & sensor-driven inputs**
- **Real-time and simulated urban parameters**

The platform is designed with a modular, extensible architecture that supports future expansion into AI-driven analytics, digital twins, and agent-based urban simulations.

---

## Technology Stack

SmartCityLite is built on modern, open web and 3D technologies, including:

- **Three.js** for real-time 3D rendering
- **IFC.js** for BIM interoperability
- **HARP / Map-based rendering pipelines**
- **WebGL-based visualisation layers**
- **Cloud-ready, API-first architecture**

This version prioritises **performance**, **scalability**, and **deployment flexibility** for both research and commercial use cases.

> ⚠️ Note: While product-ready, the platform continues to evolve as part of SDNsmartcity’s active development roadmap.

## Getting Started (Demo Features)

Current demo functionality includes:

- Uploading and geolocating **BIM (IFC) models**
- Importing **GIS (GeoJSON)** datasets as visual layers
- Simulating **sun paths and shadow analysis** via calendar-based controls

## SDNsmartcity Integration (v2)

This release represents the **second major iteration** of the SDNsmartcity platform.

Key highlights of SmartCityLite v2:

- Full integration of SDNsmartcity’s previous urban data framework
- Refactored rendering and data ingestion pipelines
- Production-oriented architecture with clearer separation of concerns
- Improved extensibility for future smart city modules
- Designed for deployment as a **shippable, real-world product**, not just a prototype

SmartCityLite v2 is positioned as the foundation layer for upcoming SDNsmartcity initiatives, including urban digital twins, sustainability analytics, and AI-assisted city planning tools.
